# Basic-Chatbot

## What is Chatbot?
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built:
<ol><ul>Retrieval based model</ul>
  <ul>Generative based model</ul></ol>
  
## About this project
In this Python project I have built a simple chatbot using deep learning techniques. 
The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I have used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then give a random response from the list of responses.
